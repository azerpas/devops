These images will then be used by other tools (Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Shell) to automate the deployment of these images to different platforms.

## Builder
Builders create machines and generate images from those machines for various platforms.

## Provisionner
Provisioners use builtin and third-party software to install and configure the machine image after booting.
